The big difference between the new model and the existing CX-90 is the CX-70 trades a third-row seat for a more efficient cargo area. These vehicles are so similar that it seems odd to market the CX-70 as a vehicle separate from the CX-90.\n\nThe CX-70 is based on the same mechanicals as the CX-90, and the two are twins in every dimension. The CX-70 offers a choice of three powertrains, two with a 3.3-liter turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine (different horsepower levels) with a mild hybrid system for added boost and efficiency. The third is a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model that adds a larger battery pack under the rear seat for the ability to travel about 25 fully electric miles on a charge. You can tell the two models apart at a glance by the wheel arch flares — black on hybrid models and painted body-color on the PHEV. Mazda says the CX-70 weighs within 100 pounds of the CX-90, so ride and handling between the two vehicles is similar.\n\nThe biggest difference between Mazda’s two largest SUVs is that the CX-70 has two rows of seats instead of three. Removing the third row created more room in the cargo hold. In fact, Mazda carved out even more space by expanding the width slightly towards the rear with expanded side panels. There’s a new sub-trunk area for increased storage — away from prying eyes. The CX-70's cabin also has power-folding rear seats.\n\nThe CX-70 competes with a wide variety of two-row SUVs such as the more expensive [BMW X5](/bmw/x5/), [Acura MDX](/acura/mdx/), and [Genesis GV80](/genesis/gv80/) at the upper end where it strikes us as a legitimate bargain. It also plays in the class a notch down in price and prestige with midsize SUVs like the [Hyundai Santa Fe](/hyundai/santa-fe/) and [Jeep Grand Cherokee](/jeep/grand-cherokee/).

The RX offered a three-row L version for five years, but Lexus dropped the RX-L after 2022, returning to a five-passenger-only RX SUV as it prepared for the TX debut. This was a good move, as the RX-L, built on the standard RX's wheelbase, had only an additional 6 inches of overall length. That meant the third row was not very spacious, and cargo capacity behind the rear seats was cramped. The all-new Lexus TX solves those issues with a longer wheelbase, which results in a spacious cabin, generous cargo capacity with or without rear passengers, and most importantly, a two-passenger third-row seat designed for adults.\n\nDue in dealer showrooms this fall, the TX will challenge other feature-laden three-row SUVs, including the slightly smaller [Acura MDX](/acura/mdx/), [Lincoln Aviator](/lincoln/aviator/), and [Volvo XC90](/volvo/xc90/). The MDX doesn't offer a hybrid version, while the TX comes with three powertrain options: a turbocharged four-cylinder for the TX 350, a hybrid-powered TX 500h, and a TX 550h+ plug-in hybrid with an expected all-electric driving range of 33 miles. The Aviator comes in a standard gasoline-powered turbocharged V6 or plug-in hybrid model, and the XC90 gets a four-cylinder turbo, a supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder, and a plug-in version of the turbo engine covered in a separate [XC90 Recharge](/volvo/xc90-recharge/) review.\n\nAlthough Lexus hasn't released a full list of features and options by trim level, we expect all versions to be well-equipped luxury SUVs. We do know all-wheel drive is available on all models, the entry-level TX 350 comes in three different trim grades (Standard, Premium, and Luxury), and all versions get a 14-inch infotainment touchscreen with the option to add a 21-speaker Mark Levinson audio system.

The all-new Revuelto replaces the Aventador at the top of Lamborghini's exotic supercar lineup and is the latest in a long line of V12-powered extreme sports cars from the Italian marque. However, for the first time, the V12 is integrated with three electric motors in a plug-in hybrid powertrain that boasts more than 1,000 horsepower.\n\nLike other Lamborghinis before it, the Revuelto is named for a famous Spanish fighting bull. However, the name in Italian means unruly (or a scrambled egg dish, but we'll go with unruly), which also seems appropriate for such a beast. The styling is pure Lamborghini, with sleek lines, a wide stance, and the iconic scissor doors. At the rear, the massive V12 engine is exposed for all to see, and the dual hexagonal exhaust outlets provide the ultimate soundtrack to this powerful machine.\n\nThe Revuelto is more than just a straight-line rocket: This supercar is built to handle the road and track. Active aerodynamics provide low drag or maximum downforce, depending on the need, and the carbon-fiber monocoque provides excellent torsional stiffness. The front electric motors also offer torque vectoring, further improving high-speed performance.\n\nWhile the Revuelto is one of the most powerful electrified sports cars on the road, automakers such as Ferrari and McLaren have also embraced electrification. The [McLaren Artura](/mclaren/artura/), [Ferrari SF90 Stradale](/ferrari/sf90/), and [Ferrari 296 GTB](/ferrari/296/) all feature plug-in hybrid powertrains that are much more about performance than efficiency.

While other engines are available outside the U.S., here it’s sold exclusively as a plug-in hybrid. Now available in Sprint, Ti, and Veloce trims, the Tonale offers an alluring combination of style, premium features, plug-in hybrid efficiency, and sporty driving dynamics. This is, at its heart, an Alfa Romeo — a brand with a rich history of building performance cars for professional racing. The introduction of a plug-in hybrid crossover doesn’t mean Alfa has forgotten its heritage. The Tonale has a healthy dose of Italian DNA with a striking exterior design that includes the distinctive Alfa Romeo grille and an elegant, sporty interior with heavily bolstered sport seats. It delivers sharp handling and a total of 285 horsepower from its plug-in hybrid engine, and it has a good range of technology and safety features. A 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is included in all Tonale trims, as are lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking.\n\nThe Tonale crossover's closest competitors include the [Lexus NX](/lexus/nx/), [Lincoln Corsair](/lincoln/corsair/), and [Audi Q5](/audi/q5/). The NX is available as a gas, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid SUV, but the plug-in model is only available in the highest trim levels, so it costs almost $10K more than the entry-level Tonale.

The BMW XM stands out, not just for its distinctive styling, but as the first-ever BMW M car to be a plug-in hybrid and as the only current M model without a non-M variant.\n\nThe XM gets BMW's iconic kidney grille, but it is flanked by extremely slim driving lights with the headlights positioned below. Slim LED taillights wrap around the corners, and the rear features a flush rear window and stacked quad exhaust outlets — all unusual design elements for a BMW.\n\nThe special powertrain sets the XM apart from just about any vehicle on the road. The plug-in hybrid system boasts a plentiful 644 horsepower, all sent to the road via BMW's M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. Acceleration from a stop in the XM could best be described as forceful — unlike an electric car that delivers smooth, linear power, the XM throws you back in the seat with the roar of its V8 — an experience not soon forgotten.\n\nOther SUVs can deliver similar performance. The [Lamborghini Urus](/lamborghini/urus/), [Aston Martin DBX](/aston-martin/dbx/), and [Maserati Levante](/maserati/levante/) are all very quick, but the BMW has an additional trick up its sleeve.

After the introduction of an Outlander compact SUV in 2022, things are looking much more optimistic. Based on the [Nissan Rogue](/nissan/rogue/), Mitsubishi has a strong platform to build upon, and in some ways the current Outlander surpasses the Rogue.\n\nThe Outlander SUV is available as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV), which already makes it a relative rarity in the market. Add in a third row of seats, a large cargo area, and sporty handling and the Outlander becomes a good value. Drawbacks to consider include a very small third-row seat. The Outlander PHEV is quite a bit more expensive than the rather sluggish standard gasoline model, and once the plug-in's battery is depleted, its fuel economy isn't any better than that non-hybrid model. But it is estimated to travel up to 38 miles of driving range on electric-only power, so if you have a short commute and easy access to charging, it's possible to break even with the hybrid price premium after a few years.\n\nAmong the few compact three-row SUVs, the 2024 Outlander is a worthy choice against the [Kia Sorento](/kia/sorento/) and [Volkswagen Tiguan](/volkswagen/tiguan/).

The Range Rover was all-new last year and has proven to be supremely popular for those shopping for the ultimate luxury SUV. Buyers are immediately attracted to its smooth, tasteful, and modern exterior design. The Range Rover makes an impression wherever it goes.\n\nThe Range Rover is a pleasure to spend time in, primarily because of its gorgeous interior. The soft leather and beautiful wood finishes combine with the almost minimalist interior design to create an elegant and upscale environment. If the standard fitments feel too plain, Range Rover has plenty of ways to make the interior even more posh.\n\nBut the best part about the Rover is the drive experience. Yes, it still has the traditional upright and commanding driving position that has been its trademark for decades. It helps make driving such a big machine relatively easy and gives a tremendous view ahead. On the open road or around town, the Range Rover expertly delivers a smooth and isolated ride thanks to the adjustable air-ride suspension. And yet, its sophisticated roll control system makes the handling quite sharp for a vehicle this tall and heavy. Of course, don’t expect this machine to tackle curves with the athleticism of a [Porsche Cayenne](/porsche/cayenne/) or [Lamborghini Urus](/lamborghini/urus/). The Range Rover is just too large, soft, and heavy. The company offers several powertrains ranging from a turbocharged six-cylinder hybrid with 395 horsepower up to a 606-hp V8 on the top SV models. The V8's power is intoxicating. It makes passing lesser machines effortless on a long freeway cruise. Plus, it’s nearly silent, even when you dig deep into the throttle. But for most buyers, the standard six-cylinder offers plenty of pace. Many eco-conscious Range Rover buyers are waiting for the fully electric EV model to launch. It’s coming this year and will ride on its own distinct chassis, but details are not yet available.\n\nThe Range Rover is a seriously capable off-roader, too. The soft suspension has gobs of travel, meaning it can absorb large ruts and bumps without transferring discomfort to the cabin. Raise the suspension to its max height and you'll have almost a foot of ground clearance. Once locked into low-range four-wheel drive, the Range Rover can handle even the toughest of trails. The four-wheel steering helps here, too. Plus, it can ford nearly 3 feet of water. But if you’re going to make a habit of off-roading a Range Rover, consider swapping the tires for ones with a meatier tread. Regardless, the Rover crushes the [Mercedes Benz GLS](/mercedes-benz/gls/) and [BMW X7](/bmw/x7/) when it comes to off-road capability.\n\nWant to be driven instead of driving? Opting for the SV model’s Signature Suite gains an even more sumptuous cabin and private jet-like accommodations. If the Range Rover’s duties are more family oriented, the long-wheelbase models with a third-row seat will make every elementary school carpooler jealous."},"overview":"For five decades, the Land Rover Range Rover has held a timeless allure for celebrities and affluent clientele worldwide.
