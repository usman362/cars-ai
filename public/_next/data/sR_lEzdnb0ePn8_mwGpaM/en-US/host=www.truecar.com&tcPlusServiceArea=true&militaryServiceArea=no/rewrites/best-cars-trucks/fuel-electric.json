first pure electric vehicle from Acura, the new 2024 ZDX enters the rapidly growing battery-electric SUV segment with a long list of impressive credentials. When it goes on sale in early 2024, the Acura ZDX will be available in two trim levels: standard A-Spec and high-performance Type S. Buyers who prefer the most range possible from their EVs will want to stick with the more efficient A-Spec trim. It's expected to deliver up to 325 miles from its 102 kWh battery. The standard ZDX A-Spec is driven by a single, 340-horsepower electric motor that drives the rear wheels, but a second motor can be optioned to add all-wheel drive. Drivers who crave more engagement will prefer the performance-tuned Type S. It comes standard with a two-motor, all-wheel-drive system rated to deliver an estimated 500 hp. The Type S also features an adjustable air suspension, Brembo brakes, adjustable drive modes, and 22-inch wheels and tires, the largest ever fitted to a production Acura model. Although it's almost as long as the three-row [Acura MDX](/acura/mdx/), the ZDX only offers seating for five in its two rows, so expect plenty of legroom in the rear seats. Up front, the dash features a standard 11.3-inch touchscreen display with Acura's new Google-powered interface, which is designed for seamless use of features such as Google maps and Google voice assistant. Every ZDX will also come with an 18-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, the first collaboration between the two brands. When the ZDX goes on sale in 2024, it will have plenty of competition among high-end electric SUVs, including the [BMW iX](/bmw/ix/), [Cadillac Lyriq](/cadillac/lyriq/), and [Genesis Electrified GV70](/genesis/electrified-gv70/), all of which offer similar levels of range, performance, and comfort."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"With plenty of driving range, impressive power, and a high-tech interior, the new Acura ZDX EV has everything it needs to be competitive in the rapidly growing electric SUV segment."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":2},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Up to 325 miles of range on a single charge.

It feels spacious on the inside, despite its low, sleek roofline. The 11.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system is relatively easy to use and there are plenty of standard tech features, such as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Legroom is abundant in the second row, and there’s a large under-floor cargo compartment in the trunk to store extra items. It’s worth noting, however, that the Prologue’s overall cargo space is merely average for the segment, and there’s no front trunk.\n\nThe range estimates for the Prologue are between 273 and 296 miles, which is average for the class, but most other EV SUVs have at least one variant with a range that exceeds 300 miles. And, unfortunately, the Prologue lacks the well-sorted driving dynamics we’re used to from most Honda vehicles. It handles corners well enough, but with light and uninspiring steering response. Acceleration is underwhelming, and there's no optional high-horsepower version to pump up the excitement.\n\nSo, there are some drawbacks, but the Prologue is still pretty appealing to most shoppers, especially since it’s one of a shrinking number of EVs with a full $7,500 federal tax credit available for qualified buyers."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"The 2024 Honda Prologue has a style all its own, with a comfortable and quiet interior, but the General Motors platform it's built on takes something away from the overall experience."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":3},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Good list of standard and optional equipment.

Its key competitor is the [Ford Mustang Mach-E](/ford/mustang-mach-e/).\n\nThe five-passenger Equinox EV is based on the flexible Ultium platform that is intended to support the vast bulk of General Motors EVs in coming years. Because of that, the Equinox EV shares a lot with the Blazer EV, including a similar 319-mile driving range. But at launch, the Equinox lacks a super-high-performance version to match the Blazer EV's 557-horsepower SS trim.\n\nThe Equinox EV follows the Blazer EV's lead with its Google Built-in infotainment system. Even base Equinox models feature a 17.7-inch digital touchscreen display with the new system.

Redesigned for 2024, the Kona also offers new standard features, a roomier rear seat and cargo area, and a fresh, sporty exterior.\n\nThe electric Kona, introduced in 2019, while well-received, was always a bit cramped and short on cargo space compared to its rivals. For 2024, though, the Kona has a new platform that's longer and wider, addressing those issues and making it much more competitive.\n\nIts chief drawbacks have been its pricing and the loss of federal tax credit eligibility (except for leased models). Hyundai hasn’t released 2024 pricing yet, but it will offer a lower-cost version equipped with a new, shorter-range battery pack.\n\nIn either version, the Kona Electric’s appeal is likely to remain with first-time EV buyers — singles, young couples, and empty nesters looking to break away from standard gas vehicles. Note, though, that in 2023 Hyundai sold the Kona Electric in just 26 states; it still considers much of the middle of the country to be poor EV territory.\n\nThe beginner EV competitive set is small but soon will include a hot new entry: Volvo’s stylish [EX30](/volvo/ex30/). Shoppers might also want to consider the Kona’s corporate cousin, the [Kia Niro EV](/kia/niro-ev/), which was redesigned for 2023, as well as the [Nissan Leaf](/nissan/leaf/), and base trims of the [Volkswagen ID.4](/volkswagen/id-4/) and [Tesla Model Y](/tesla/model-y/). After a series of price cuts, and with its eligibility for a $7,500 federal tax credit, the Model Y just makes it into the sub-$40,000 category.\n\nThe current-generation [Chevrolet Bolt EV](/chevrolet/bolt-ev/) and [Bolt EUV](/chevrolet/bolt-euv/) will be discontinued at the end of 2023.

The midsize three-row crossover is Kia's flagship electric vehicle. Its predecessor, the [Kia EV6](/kia/ev6/), has been a big hit. (Numbers 7 and 8, expected to be a midsize crossover and a sport sedan, respectively, will follow the EV9.) The EV9 represents Kia’s bid to meet U.S. demand for big vehicles and, while classed as a midsize, it is big inside. The EV9 measures almost 16.5 feet in length, making it the same size as the non-electric [Kia Telluride](/kia/telluride/) and [Hyundai Palisade](/hyundai/palisade/) three-row crossovers, but its much longer wheelbase opens up interior space.\n\nWhile the EV9 is almost 2 feet shorter than the full-size [Chevrolet Suburban](/chevrolet/suburban/), it offers almost as much first- and second-row legroom and more second- and third-row headroom. The Suburban handily beats the EV9 in cargo space and third-row legroom, but the gas-burning Chevy can’t come close to matching the electric Kia in efficiency or clean emissions.\n\nThere are a number of three-row SUVs and crossovers with standard gasoline engines, but as an electric vehicle, the EV9 is in a small group. Its rivals, the [Rivian R1S](/rivian/r1s/), [Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV](/mercedes-benz/eqs-suv/), [Tesla Model X](/tesla/model-x/), and the upcoming [VinFast VF9](/vinfast/vf9/), all start well above the EV9’s pricing. The VinFast and Rivian base trims might compete price-wise with the top end of the EV9 lineup, but VinFast first must overcome the wave of poor reviews received by its North American debut model, the [VF8](/vinfast/vf8/) two-row crossover.\n\nFor now, the EV9’s likeliest competitors will be the smaller [Mercedes-Benz EQB](/mercedes-benz/eqb/), the three-row version of the [Tesla Model Y Long Range](/tesla/model-y/), and the upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Toyota bZ5X.

It is larger than the original, but remains one of the smallest cars available.\n\nWith more than three dozen rival EV sedans, coupes, and SUVs, most offering a lot more space and range, the new 500e is likely to rely on continental charm and niche marketing. It's a city car that’s easy to park and maneuver through traffic, not one touted for performance, capacity, or long driving range. Among its charms, the new 500e follows its federally mandated electronic tones for pedestrian warnings with an actual piece of music composed just for the tiny Fiat.\n\nFiat plans to launch the 500e with a base trim level called the 500e (RED) and then to strategically “drop” special editions throughout the rest of the model year at a rate of two or three per quarter. The strategy was borrowed from musicians who drop new tunes onto popular streaming services from time to time to keep their fans interested. All of the 500e special editions will be priced higher than the (RED), which starts at $34,095.\n\nThat pricing, along with its size and sub-200-mile range, mean the Fiat 500e's most direct competition will likely be the [Mini Electric Hardtop](/mini/electric-hardtop/). The larger but still sub-$40,000 [Hyundai Kona Electric](/hyundai/kona-electric/) and [Nissan Leaf](/nissan/leaf/) will be in the mix as well. Fiat is positioning the 500e as the ideal first new car — just coincidentally an EV — for many younger drivers, as well as great around-town transportation for empty nesters and urban dwellers looking to beat congestion and parking woes.\n\nFiat says it will sell the 500e in all 50 states, using its existing network of 352 dealerships, new dealerships it plans to add in the coming year, and on-lines sales as well."},"overview":"The Fiat 500e is a subcompact hatchback EV that takes Italian style and pep and blends in environmental sustainability.","editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"Cute and quirky, the new 2024 Fiat 500e will likely find a loyal following among city dwellers and young drivers."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":3},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Cute design.

It’s the performance version of the [Audi Q8 e-tron](/audi/q8-e-tron/), and with a starting price just over $90,000 this SUV guarantees a level of exclusivity. The nearly 500-horsepower five-passenger EV comes in either a standard SUV body style or a more coupe-like Sportback model. How do you spot an SQ8 e-tron compared to the regular Q8 e-tron? Look for the slightly flared-out bodywork covering distinctive wheels and wider tires. The SQ8 e-tron looks muscular and performance-oriented, and has a number of significant upgrades over the standard model.\n\nMost of that work is in the chassis. Audi has retuned the suspension with thicker sway bars and firmer dampers. They’ve made the steering more responsive, as well. But the biggest change is the addition of a second electric motor on the rear axle. When combined with the single front axle motor, it allows this three-motor Audi to instantly send power and torque to the wheels in need. The SQ8 e-tron also has an additional 94 hp and 228 pound-feet of torque over the standard Q8 e-tron. These upgrades help this large and heavy EV tackle sweeping roads and tight corners with the athleticism of a much smaller vehicle. The brake regen system, which helps charge the battery as you slow down, isn’t as aggressive as in some other EVs. For example there’s no “one-pedal” drive mode in which drag from the regen system lets the driver cruise around town, rarely touching the brake pedal. The driver can amp up the regen temporarily by pulling on one of the steering wheel-mounted paddles.\n\nThe SQ8 e-tron cabin is fitted with beautiful textured carbon accents, rich-looking (and comfortable) quilted Valcona leather sport seats, and a sport steering wheel.\n\nThe SQ8 e-tron has few true rivals. The [Tesla Model X Plaid](/tesla/model-x/), which costs just over $94,000, offers longer range and way more speed but is less comfortable and luxurious.

It doesn’t offer the same cargo capacity or rear-seat space, but it provides a refreshing new look compared to the Ioniq 5's boxy SUV styling.\n\nWith up to 361 miles of driving range (270 with all-wheel drive), the Ioniq 6 is a midsize sedan with the roominess of a larger model. Because most automakers continue to favor crossover EVs over sedans, the Ioniq 6 has few direct rivals. Competitors include the [Tesla Model 3](/tesla/model-3/) sedan, [Ford Mustang Mach-E](/ford/mustang-mach-e/) coupe-like crossover, [Polestar 2](/polestar/2/) hatchback sedan, and [BMW i4](/bmw/i4/) sedan.

But both are built in North America, and thus qualify for a federal clean vehicles tax credit, which lowers their price compared to the Ioniq 6. The BMW and Polestar cost more than the Ioniq 6 and, like it, don't qualify for the federal tax credit because they are built overseas.\n\nThe only areas in which the Ioniq 6 falls short is in cargo space and horsepower.

The original e-tron SUV, Audi's first all-electric vehicle, debuted in 2019, and this new Q8 e-tron shares much of its style, internal components, and personality.\n\nThe Q8 part of the name will likely cause some confusion since this EV isn't directly related to the slightly larger gasoline-powered [Q8](/audi/q8/), also introduced in 2019. The e-tron moniker will continue to distinguish Audi's electric vehicles from its internal combustion models.\n\nIn terms of style, the new Q8 e-tron could be hard to tell apart from its predecessor. There's a new grille frame that extends under the headlights, but that's as different as the exterior gets. The interior is virtually a dead ringer for the previous e-tron. The most significant changes are found in the spec sheet. The Q8 e-tron is more aerodynamic, has an increased battery capacity, and more efficient motors. Combined, they contribute to an estimated range of 285 miles, which is a significant upgrade from the older e-tron's 222-mile range.\n\nThe e-tron was a solid pick among electric luxury SUVs when it debuted, but in the time since, the competition has grown and surpassed it.
