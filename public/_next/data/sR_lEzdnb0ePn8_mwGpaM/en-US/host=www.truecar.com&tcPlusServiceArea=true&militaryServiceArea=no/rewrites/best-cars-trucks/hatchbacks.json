sporty coupes go, there's nothing quite like the Mini Cooper. It has one-of-a-kind styling inside and out and performance that makes it a thrill to drive. Fully redesigned this year, the 2025 Mini Hardtop gets revised styling, new features, and an upgraded cabin with a more premium feel.\n\nWith every new generation, Mini rolls out its new models in phases, so the two-door hardtop is the first to show off the new styling. It's still very much in tune with its predecessors, with round headlights sunken into a steeply raked front end and a two-tone roof, but new triangular taillights help distinguish it from older models.\n\nThere will be two models sold in the United States: the base Cooper hardtop and the higher-performance Cooper S hardtop. Both are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that sends power to the front wheels. The Cooper S is rated at 201 horsepower, which is slightly more than the previous version. Mini says everything about the suspension is geared toward agile handling, so sharp steering, minimal body roll, and excellent stopping power remain part of the package.\n\nThe new interior design is dominated by the 9-inch, circular touchscreen that sits front and center in the dashboard. Mini says it's the first OLED display in the industry so the readability and colors are exceptional. The rest of the interior is a mix of soft-touch materials and metallic accents that contribute to the premium feel. There's also a variety of driver-selectable \"Mini experience modes\" that adjust the graphics and ambient lighting in the cabin to reflect different themes.\n\nGiven the Mini's unusual characteristics, there aren't many direct competitors. The [Audi A3](/audi/a3/) has similar levels of performance and luxury but a more conventional hatchback design. The [BMW 2 Series](/bmw/2-series/) is a traditional coupe with great performance, but it has a substantially higher price. Additional versions of the new Mini, such as a four-door model, are expected to follow later in the year."},"overview":"The Mini Hardtop is the modern-day version of the classic Cooper of the 1960s — sporty, charming, and a lot of fun to drive.

Not a fast sports car or an adventurous off-roader, the 2024 Toyota Prius is nonetheless a car we want to drive again. For starters, it just looks better. Its sleek design sacrifices some interior room for sporty proportions that, with a long front end, low roof, and truncated rear quarters, looks more like something we'd expect from Mazda's house of zoom. The interior, too, feels more normal and not overly wrought with quirky tech design.\n\nImproved body rigidity and handling haven't transformed the Prius into a sports car overnight, but it's no longer a numb embarrassment when pushed through a quick corner, either. More important, the Prius remains a fuel-efficiency champ and an aspirational target for hypermilers. With 49 to 57 mpg, the Prius is both a tech triumph and king of the commute.\n\nCrossovers and SUVs are rapidly replacing sedans and hatchback-like sedans, leaving the Prius with few direct competitors. The [Kia Niro](/kia/niro/) hybrid, a small hatch with a bit more cargo space, comes close but falls a bit short in fuel economy. The [Hyundai Elantra](/hyundai/elantra/) hybrid is about the same size as the Prius, costs less, and comes close in efficiency. Toyota’s own [Corolla](/toyota/corolla/) hybrid sedan is about the same size and costs less, but it can't match the Prius' liftback versatility, and the [hatchback](/toyota/corolla-hatchback/) version isn't available as a hybrid."},"overview":"The Toyota Prius delivers sophistication and style without sacrificing its bread-and-butter: excellent fuel economy.

Think of it as a Corolla that has been completely re-engineered by a racing team, because that’s exactly what it is. In Toyota-speak, GR is the fun stuff. It stands for Gazoo Racing, which is the automaker's in-house race team, and Toyota now sells three high-performance GR models in the U.S.: the GR Corolla, [Toyota GR Supra](/toyota/gr-supra/), and [Toyota GR86](/toyota/gr86/). Toyota’s race engineers have fortified this little turbocharged hatchback with 300 horsepower, a driver-adjustable all-wheel-drive system, a racetrack-tuned suspension, upgraded brakes, and sticky performance tires. And like its rivals, the front-wheel-drive [Honda Civic Type R](/honda/civic/) and [Acura Integra Type S](/acura/integra/), the GR Corolla is only available with a manual transmission — a slick-shifting six-speed. The rally racer-inspired hot hatch is even offered with a carbon-fiber roof to shave weight, and front and rear limited-slip differentials. The ride is comfortable enough for everyday use, as is the Toyota’s cabin, which features sport seats with added side bolstering. All of the convenience features of the standard Corolla are retained, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

You also get good gas mileage, a cavernous hatchback trunk, advanced safety features, and sturdy build quality. The Impreza is a master of getting through ugly weather, forging paths through snow that other small cars wouldn't dream of. A 2024 update brings welcome updates to the Impreza's powertrains, and the sporty new RS trim is clearly related to the Subaru WRX rocket sled. If you need a small car that is easy to live with and well-equipped for an active lifestyle, the Impreza should be at the top of your list.","editorial({\"section\":\"OVERVIEW\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"Subaru has made its name by, in the parlance of today, staying in its lane. Compared to its larger Japanese competitors, Subaru’s focus on practical, affordable, and adventurous cars and SUVs has earned it a loyal fanbase. It hasn’t hurt that, for a time, the automaker also dominated global rally racing, highlighting the brand’s robust build quality and advanced all-wheel-drive systems.\n\nThe Subaru Impreza won’t dominate motorsports, but it has everything necessary for a sensible commuter and weekend explorer. The cabin is roomy and comfortable, and there’s loads of cargo space — more than most competitors — when you fold down the rear seats.\n\nThe 2024 model kicks off the Impreza’s sixth generation, but it remains largely the same as before. The front and rear ends have a new grille and head- and taillight style. Under the metal, the Impreza uses more structural adhesive, which Subaru says helps make the car 10% stiffer and more resistant to twist and flex. But the Impreza’s dimensions haven’t changed much — it’s slightly taller — meaning it’s as easy to park and maneuver as before.\n\nInside the cabin, new seat mounts help improve ride comfort, and the infotainment interface grows to a 7-inch standard touchscreen, or an 11.6-inch display in the middle and top trims. Subaru’s EyeSight driver safety system also gets an update with a wider-view camera and a new feature that can automatically steer away from a collision at speeds less than 50 mph. A new RS trim conjures up earlier performance glory (the RS preceded the high-performance [Subaru WRX](/subaru/wrx/) model) with a larger engine and slightly more power. Finally, the sedan body style and manual transmission are gone, leaving only a hatchback with an automatic shifter.\n\nNone of these changes make the Impreza any faster or more fuel-efficient, though. The RS trim promises a bit more speed, but we’ll need to wait for testing. The Impreza’s sluggish and thirsty ways make rivals like the [Honda Civic Hatchback](/honda/civic/), [Toyota Corolla Hatchback](/toyota/corolla-hatchback/), and [Mazda 3 Hatchback (/mazda/mazda3) worthy considerations.

For 2025, all but one trim level is offered in both sedan and hatchback styles. With nearly 200 hp/200 lb-ft of torque, the base engine makes enough sauce to easily close gaps in traffic, and every Mazda3 comes with a bundle of driver aids and tech essentials like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThere are alternatives, though. The [Honda Civic](/honda/civic/) spans a similar range of sensible to sporty, and the [Hyundai Elantra](/hyundai/elantra/), while not quite as sharp in a turn, offers invigorating performance in its sport trims. The [Subaru Impreza](/subaru/impreza/) and [WRX](/subaru/wrx/) come standard with all-wheel drive, and the [Toyota Corolla](/toyota/corolla/) — another smart and practical choice — offers the uncharacteristically wild 300-hp [Corolla GR](/toyota/gr-corolla/). Many rivals also cost less than the Mazda3, while offering roomier interiors and more cargo space. Still, for the Mazda's more polished feel and crackling performance, we think it's a fair trade."},"overview":"The Mazda3 is the compact car to get if style and driving fun are at the top of the list.

Compact hatchbacks offer the efficiency and maneuverability of a compact sedan combined with the utility of an easy-to-access cargo area. It's a configuration that used to be part of most automakers' lineups, but with the popularity of small SUVs, compact hatchbacks like this one have become far less common.\n\nBased on the popular [Corolla](/toyota/corolla/) sedan, the Corolla Hatchback features the same base engine and standard front-wheel drive. With 169 horsepower, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder packs a solid punch that gives the Corolla Hatchback plenty of pickup around town and usable power on the highway. The suspension delivers a well-composed ride that favors comfort over performance. Long drives are especially pleasant thanks to the comfortable seats, standard adaptive cruise control, and a 41-mpg highway fuel-efficiency rating.\n\nThere are just three trim levels for the Corolla Hatchback — SE, Nightshade, and XSE — so it's easy to choose your best fit. All are well-equipped with automatic climate control, a leather-trimmed steering wheel with auxiliary controls, an 8-inch touchscreen display with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and selectable drive modes. The Nightshade version adds distinctive black exterior trim and 18-inch bronze wheels. Passenger room up front is plentiful although rear seat footroom is tight. Behind the rear seat is 17.8 cubic feet of cargo space, a nice bump up from the Corolla sedan's 13-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nAlthough the hatchback category has shrunk over the years, there are still a few solid competitors. The [Honda Civic](/honda/civic/) continues to offer great value, a comfortable ride, and a wide range of trim levels. The [Mazda3](/mazda/mazda3/) is another great hatchback with a sporty ride, eye-catching styling, and solid value. For a slightly different take on the traditional hatch, there's the [Kia Soul](/kia/soul/). It's sized and priced similar to the Corolla hatchback, but has more upright styling and a slightly lower starting price."},"overview":"Offering a touch of sportiness alongside everyday practicality, the Corolla Hatchback caters to young drivers and commuters with no-fuss reliability, an available manual transmission, and standard safety features.","editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"The 2025 Toyota Corolla Hatchback is a great example of a versatile small car packed with features and safety technology."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":3},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Hatchback versatility.

The five-seat compact hatchback is available in just two trims, and we think the base S version is the best value. The SV Plus costs almost as much as the base trim of the [Nissan Ariya](/nissan/ariya/), which launched as a 2023 model and offers as much or more range, more modern tech, better battery management, and more performance and premium touches than either Leaf trim.\n\nThe base Leaf S is a bargain for buyers looking for an EV that can provide reliable, economical service as a grocery hauler and commuter car. Its closest competitors all cost more than the base Leaf. The rival [Fiat 500e](/fiat/500e/) and [Mini Electric Hardtop](/mini/electric-hardtop/) are substantially smaller and don't offer any more range. The Mini travels only two-thirds of the range delivered by the base Leaf but still starts at almost $3,000 more. A third potential competitor, the [Hyundai Kona Electric](/hyundai/kona-electric/), is nearly the same size as the base Leaf and offers substantially more range but at an almost $5,000 premium.\n\nAs far as the upper-trim Leaf SV Plus goes, it has slightly more than 200 miles of range but is outclassed in looks, range, and power by almost all of its compact EV competition. This group includes the [Kia Niro EV](/kia/niro-ev/), [Ford Mustang Mach-E](/ford/mustang-mach-e/), and [Volkswagen ID.4](/volkswagen/id-4/). The Leaf SV-Plus' saving grace is that it costs less than any of the others. That's until Chevrolet releases the promised $34,995 base version of the new [Equinox EV](/chevrolet/equinox-ev/), expected for sometime in 2025. It will likely qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit that cuts its real cost to $27,495 — almost $2,000 less than the base Leaf S.\n\nOverall, the 2025 Nissan Leaf beats existing competitors on price and can be a good deal for EV shoppers who don't need to drive many miles between charging sessions."},"overview":"A compelling choice for budget-savvy eco-commuters, the 2025 Nissan LEAF offers two battery options for customizable range (up to 212 miles) and standard safety features like automatic emergency braking, making it a secure and value-oriented electric hatchback.
