It has a handsome exterior design, hybrid powertrain, and an interior that sets a new benchmark for luxe and tech in this class. Unlike past generations, which included a coupe, convertible, and wagon, the new E-Class will only be offered as a four-door sedan. This is likely a nod to slowing coupe sales and buyers' preference for SUVs over traditional station wagons.\n\nThe new E-Class is available in two models: the 255-horsepower E 350 4Matic (which means all-wheel drive in Mercedes-Benz speak) and the 375-hp E 450 4Matic. The 350 offers a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a new mild hybrid system. The top 450 has an inline six-cylinder engine like the previous E-Class lineup, but with a revised hybrid system. Both models have more power than last year, yet fuel economy stays about the same. The E 450 can hit 60 mph in a brisk 4.4 seconds. Top models have an air suspension system for a smoother ride as well as four-wheel steering to aid maneuverability, ultimately shaving about 3 feet off the turning radius.\n\nThis generation of E-Class arrives with a new infotainment system, offering an impressive optional display that extends dramatically across the entire length of the dash. When equipped with this option, front-seat passengers can stream video or take selfies and video when the car is parked. The top trim with the Pinnacle package offers an impressive Burmester 4D sound system and active ambient lighting. There’s more room inside (and in the trunk) than in the previous E-Class, too, so everyone will have more space to stretch out.\n\nWhen it comes to exterior dimensions, Mercedes-Benz has capped the overall size of the E-Class. It’s just over a half-inch longer than the previous model, but is 2 inches wider and sits on a slightly longer wheelbase. This allowed designers to carve out more interior space without increasing the exterior dimensions. The main E-Class rivals are close in size. The [BMW 5 Series](/bmw/5-series/) is a bit wider and sits on an inch-longer wheelbase. The [Audi A6](/audi/a6/) is about the same length as the Benz, but has a shorter wheelbase. The E-Class is arguably the most stylish of the three."},"overview":"Effortlessly blending everyday luxury with sporty performance, the E-Class sets the standard for midsize sedans.","editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"The all-new 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a solid step forward in presence, luxury, and technology, bringing it closer to the flagship S-Class."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":2},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Posh, refined interior.

It represents an intriguing middle ground between the mild hybrid four- and six-cylinder models and the all-electric [BMW i5](/bmw/i5/), which is reviewed separately. Not only is the 550e more fuel-efficient, but it also delivers an impressive 483 horsepower. If that's not enough, there is also the high-performance [BMW M5](/bmw/m5/) (also reviewed separately) with an incredible 717 hp.\n\nAll 5 Series variants adhere to an underlying performance focus that has defined the model since its 1972 debut. This is especially true when comparing it to the more opulent and comfortable [Mercedes-Benz E-Class](/mercedes-benz/e-class/), redesigned last year. Meanwhile, the aging [Audi A6](/audi/a6/) balances performance and comfort equally.\n\nWhile all these sedans have their merits, the 5 Series stands out for its spacious trunk.

The fun-to-drive sedan has been the brand’s best performer for more than 20 years, and it remains one of our favorite sport compacts. The 2024 WRX delivers impressive performance value with 271 horsepower, standard all-wheel drive, and a responsive sport-tuned suspension.

Nail the gas and the Subaru’s torque-y engine brings the thunder, pushing you back in the seat as it charges to its 6,100 rpm redline. The standard slick-shifting six-speed manual dials up the driver engagement, but the WRX is actually a bit quicker off the line with its available automatic transmission. It’s also a blast to drive on a challenging mountain road, with quick steering, strong brakes, and impressive road holding. Fuel economy lags its rivals, but the WRX is a comfortable daily driver with a well-finished cabin, a roomy backseat, and a sizable trunk. Its available Recaro sport front seats are shaped to perfection, and its infotainment system is easy to operate.

The Elantra has a surprisingly roomy interior for a compact sedan, with a wide range of trims that include everything from hybrids to the high-performance N for those who crave a more spirited driving experience.

If that kind of performance is too tame, there's also the CT4-V Blackwing, which swaps in a 472-hp twin-turbo V6 and a six-speed manual transmission, and can reach 60 mph in about 4 seconds, according to independent testers. The CT4-V's rear-wheel drive and short wheelbase — roughly 2 to 3 inches shorter than its rivals — enhance its engaging feel.\n\nIn daily driving, the CT4-V accommodates its front passengers with ample legroom. A power-adjustable front passenger seat now comes standard for 2025. The back seat is only for kids, though, or maybe short hops with adults.

The [BMW 3 Series](/bmw/3-series/), by comparison, offers 6 more cubic feet.\n\nThe CT4-V's cabin doesn't measure up either.
