Toyota Tacomas don’t come along that often. The 2023 model’s generation dates back to 2016. Despite that, in 2022 the Tacoma outpaced the combined sales of its segment rivals the [Ford Ranger](/ford/ranger/), [Chevrolet Colorado](/chevrolet/colorado/), and [Nissan Frontier](/nissan/frontier/). One reason for the Tacoma’s recent success has been its variety of available models. The 2024 Toyota Tacoma provides even more options with the addition of the TRD PreRunner and Trailhunter trims.\n\nExcept for Ford’s smaller [Maverick](/ford/maverick/), no other automaker offers a gas-electric hybrid midsize pickup. With more power and torque, and likely better fuel economy than the average midsize pickup, the 2024 Tacoma I-Force Max hybrid builds upon Toyota’s experience with hybrid-electrified drivetrains. And it may well be a game-changer in the segment. Launching this spring, it becomes the standard powertrain in the TRD Pro and Trailhunter models and available as an upgrade in the TRD Off-Road, TRD Sport, and Limited trims.\n\nThe redesigned Tacoma also addresses shortcomings in previous models. The newly raised front seat and longer steering column improve driving ergonomics. Vehicle dynamics are honed with a smoother-riding multilink coil-spring rear suspension replacing the more basic rear leaf-spring setup in most double cab models. Crisper four-wheel disc brakes and an electronic brake booster replace the previous disc/drum vacuum-booster setup. For those who like to shift their own gears, the new Tacoma still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but improves it with rev-matching for smoother downshifts, anti-stall launch technology, and a clutch start cancel feature that lets you start the pickup in gear on steep terrain. The 2024 Tacoma also offers towing aids such as a trailer brake controller and back-up guidance."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"Featuring an expanded lineup of eight highly differentiated models, the all-new 2024 Toyota Tacoma offers an impressive midsize pickup truck for every type of buyer."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":11},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Hybrid powertrain offers class-leading torque.

All Canyons come as a four-door crew cab with a 5-foot bed, and four-wheel drive is standard on all but the base-level Elevation, on which it is optional.\n\nGMC offers the Canyon in five trim levels, including the luxurious and well-equipped Denali as well as the off-road-ready AT4, AT4X, and new for 2024, the AT4X AEV Edition. Unlike its Chevrolet sibling, all Canyons are equipped with a 2.7-liter high-output turbocharged V6 engine putting out a plentiful 310 horsepower. A smooth-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission is also standard; no manual gearbox is offered. Aside from the Elevation trim, Canyons are fitted with GMC’s Autotrac two-speed transfer case that features a 4WD LO mode as well as an Auto mode, the latter providing an all-wheel-drive system, ideal for wet road conditions.\n\nAs one of the newest offerings in the midsize truck market, the Canyon shines when it comes to style, capability, and standard equipment. GMC also has equipped the Canyon with the latest advanced driver-assist features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, as well as lane-keeping assist with lane-departure warning.\n\nWith impressive off-road chops — especially with the new AT4X AEV Edition — the Canyon holds its own against other off-road trucks like the tough [Jeep Gladiator](/jeep/gladiator/).

The truck had remained primarily unchanged since 2015, but now riding on a new chassis, the updated pickup delivers an improved ride, more interior space, and excellent off-road capability.\n\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Colorado stands out with a wide grille flanked by slim headlights, overlaid by a bar bearing the classic Chevrolet bowtie logo. This look is styled after the [Chevrolet Silverado 1500](/chevrolet/silverado-1500/) full-size pickup. Offered exclusively as a four-door crew cab, the Colorado is available with a range of stylish wheels and tires that vary by trim level.\n\nInside, there's room for five with good storage throughout the cabin. The updated infotainment system is easy to use and is displayed on an 11.3-inch screen in all trim levels. Popular features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard across the model line.\n\nChevrolet offers the Colorado in five trim levels up to the off-road-ready ZR2. The standard engine in all trims is a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine; however, power output for higher trims bumps up from the base-level 237-horsepower to 310 hp. Power is sent to the road via an eight-speed automatic transmission. When equipped with the higher-output engine, the Colorado boasts class-leading towing capacity, rated at 7,700 pounds. This figure is matched only by the [Jeep Gladiator](/jeep/gladiator/).\n\nIn addition to its hauling and towing capabilities, the Colorado is ready for adventure with a choice of two off-road-ready trim levels: Trail Boss and ZR2. These trucks come with factory lift kits, off-road tires, specific off-road displays, and a wider chassis that enhances their off-road capability. But for those who want to tackle the most extreme terrain, Chevrolet has added the Bison package for the Colorado ZR2. The ZR2 Bison is a result of a partnership with American Expedition Vehicles (AEV). This special truck features an impressive 12.2 inches of ground clearance, 35-inch Mud/Terrain tires, locking front- and rear-differentials, and boron steel skid plates.\n\nThe Colorado has a lot to offer, but it has some tough competition in the midsize truck segment from the [Jeep Gladiator](/jeep/gladiator/), [Toyota Tacoma](/toyota/tacoma/), and [Nissan Frontier](/nissan/frontier/).

It looks a bit like the larger and more powerful [GMC Hummer EV Pickup](/gmc/hummer-ev-pickup/) introduced in 2020. And both trucks borrow from the 20-year-old Chevy Avalanche with cab and frame in one unit, stiffened by flying buttress “sail” panels that extend from the rear of the cab roof down to the forward rails of the bed. The Silverado EV also reprises the Avalanche’s mid-gate, which opens the back of the cab beneath the rear window to lengthen the pickup bed’s cargo area when needed.\n\nStill, the Silverado EV is only the fourth mass-production, full-size electric pickup to hit the market, and that gives it groundbreaker cred.

While they can't tow or haul as much as full-size models, small pickups have other significant benefits. They're easier to maneuver, more fuel-efficient, and more fun to drive, not to mention less expensive. Available with a choice of two engines, front- or all-wheel drive, and a wide variety of trim levels, the 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz can play the part of a budget pickup or a loaded-up lifestyle activity vehicle.\n\nA midsize alternative for those who want something between a compact and a full-size truck is the [Honda Ridgeline](/honda/ridgeline/).\n\nIf you're in the market for a light-duty pickup, you'd do well to check out the Santa Cruz.

The Hummer EV truck made a huge impact two years ago, reviving a name once synonymous with SUV excess and indifference to fuel economy with an all-electric platform and a coat of eco-credibility. The 2024 GMC Hummer EV Pickup seeks to further update that old image with an eye toward a more sustainable future.\n\nThat starts with sustaining customers. The Hummer EV's initial launch was limited to a loaded, six-figure trim level, but for 2024 GMC adds two trims that cost less and offer slightly less power, performance, and range. And while driving range remains a top concern for most EV buyers, the Hummer EV offers reassuring estimates. The top-trim EV3X is rated at nearly 330 miles, while the two supporting trims should average 250 to 300 miles. Those are impressive numbers given the Hummer EV's weight — 9,000 pounds — and brisk acceleration (capable of zero to 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds).\n\nIt's only possible with an enormous battery (about twice the size of a regular EV battery) that, echoing its past, makes the Hummer EV spectacularly inefficient. GMC claims the Hummer EV gets about 47 MPGe combined (a measurement of distance traveled per unit of energy). That's about half of what the [Rivian R1T](/rivian/r1t/) can do (70 MPGe).\n\nYou don't buy a Hummer expecting efficiency. But you can expect an impressive tech buffet. Rear-wheel steering gives it the turning circle of a small sedan. Its innovative CrabWalk feature is a neat party trick, but it means the Hummer can maneuver in and out of tight spaces and has some potential off-road uses. Its Super Cruise hands-free driving system is one of the best available today.\n\nThe Hummer doesn't really have a direct rival. The long-awaited Tesla CyberTruck could be a formidable foe if it is ever produced. There are also alternative e-trucks. The [Ford F-150 Lightning](/ford/f-150-lightning/) and [Rivian R1T](/rivian/r1t/) are smaller, less expensive, and can tow up to 11,000 pounds (though not very far, according to initial reports, due to heavy loads draining the battery). The Hummer EV Pickup is only rated up to 8,500 pounds.\n\nThe competitive field will widen with GMC's own Sierra EV Denali 1, which will use some of the Hummer EV tech, and, to a lesser degree, the forthcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV.

The Gladiator is well suited to all types of terrain, but in Rubicon guise, it has few rivals when it comes to tackling rocky trails at slow speed. The Mojave model is equally adept at keeping pace in higher-speed off-road environments. But unlike some competitors, even the base Sport model is a solid off-roader right from the factory. Plus it can be upgraded with an exhaustive line of aftermarket parts. It’s easy to find parts for these Jeeps, largely because from the cab forward, the Gladiator is a [Jeep Wrangler](/jeep/wrangler/). Like the Wrangler, the Gladiator comes with either a soft-top or hardtop, making it the only convertible pickup truck on the market. With a maximum payload of 1,725 pounds and a towing capacity of 7,700 pounds, the Gladiator and its 5-foot bed are well suited for real work.\n\nThe 2024 Gladiator gets a new Wrangler-like grille and an impressive new interior with optional power-adjustable seats, a new instrument panel, and an excellent 12.3-inch touchscreen. New trail-focused Mojave X and Rubicon X models include more standard luxury and off-road equipment, and the Willys model is more capable, too. But at the core, the Gladiator is the same machine it’s been since its launch in 2020.\n\nUnder the hood is a 285-horsepower V6 that can be paired to a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic. It’s the only engine choice, unlike the [Jeep Wrangler](/jeep/wrangler/), which has four powertrain options. And the V6 is a bit old-tech compared to its turbocharged rivals. Off-the-line acceleration around town is acceptable, but other trucks, such as the [Chevrolet Colorado](/chevrolet/colorado/) offer more potent engine options.\n\nThe very things that make the Jeep Gladiator an impressive off-roader create a less street-friendly driving experience. The Gladiator uses an old-tech solid front axle while every other midsize truck has an independent front suspension that delivers a better ride and much more precise steering. Similarly, the Gladiator has a bit rougher ride than other midsize trucks. That said, the Jeep has a style and charisma that few can match: It looks purposeful and rugged.\n\nMidsize pickup trucks are about to have a major renaissance. This year alone, there are updated versions of the Colorado, [GMC Canyon](/gmc/canyon/), [Ford Ranger](/ford/ranger/), and [Toyota Tacoma](/toyota/tacoma/).
