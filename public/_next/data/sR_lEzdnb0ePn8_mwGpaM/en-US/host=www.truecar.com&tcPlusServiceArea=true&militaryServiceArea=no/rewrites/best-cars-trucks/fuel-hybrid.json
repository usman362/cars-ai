Introduced almost 25 years ago, the 2024 Santa Fe enters its fifth generation as one of Hyundai's best-selling models.\n\nThe updated Santa Fe gets a stylish, squared-off design that not only is a significant departure from the previous generation, but also doesn't look like any other model in the lineup. The vertical grille, high hood, and slim headlights connected by an LED light bar give the Santa Fe a wide appearance. Bold fender flares contribute to the powerful look, further enhanced by available 21-inch wheels. A large rear tailgate opens considerably wider than the previous generation for easier loading and unloading.\n\nOne of the more noteworthy changes for the 2024 Santa Fe is the return of the third-row seat, now standard in all trim levels. The Santa Fe is still about 7 inches shorter than the three-row Palisade, so they should appeal to different buyers. Most SUVs in this class, such as the [Chevrolet Blazer](/chevrolet/blazer/) and [Honda Passport](/honda/passport/), don't offer a third row. Its [Kia Sorento](/kia/sorento/) cousin has a third row but is slightly less roomy, and the [Volkswagen Tiguan](/volkswagen/tiguan/) and [Mitsubishi Outlander](/mitsubishi/outlander/) have considerably less legroom.\n\nWith two potent powerplants — including a fuel-efficient hybrid — and a long list of standard equipment, the 2024 Santa Fe is a strong contender in the very competitive midsize SUV market."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"A roomier interior, new advanced features, and standard three-row seating should keep the redesigned 2024 Santa Fe Hyundai in the top tier of midsize SUVs."},"trims":{"edges":[],"pageInfo":{"hasPreviousPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"startCursor":"","endCursor":""},"__typename":"TrimConnection","totalCount":8},"pros":[],"cons":[],"editorial({\"section\":\"PROS\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","title":"Pros","text":"Stylish new exterior.

The 2023 model’s generation dates back to 2016. Despite that, in 2022 the Tacoma outpaced the combined sales of its segment rivals the [Ford Ranger](/ford/ranger/), [Chevrolet Colorado](/chevrolet/colorado/), and [Nissan Frontier](/nissan/frontier/). One reason for the Tacoma’s recent success has been its variety of available models. The 2024 Toyota Tacoma provides even more options with the addition of the TRD PreRunner and Trailhunter trims.\n\nExcept for Ford’s smaller [Maverick](/ford/maverick/), no other automaker offers a gas-electric hybrid midsize pickup. With more power and torque, and likely better fuel economy than the average midsize pickup, the 2024 Tacoma I-Force Max hybrid builds upon Toyota’s experience with hybrid-electrified drivetrains. And it may well be a game-changer in the segment. Launching this spring, it becomes the standard powertrain in the TRD Pro and Trailhunter models and available as an upgrade in the TRD Off-Road, TRD Sport, and Limited trims.\n\nThe redesigned Tacoma also addresses shortcomings in previous models. The newly raised front seat and longer steering column improve driving ergonomics. Vehicle dynamics are honed with a smoother-riding multilink coil-spring rear suspension replacing the more basic rear leaf-spring setup in most double cab models. Crisper four-wheel disc brakes and an electronic brake booster replace the previous disc/drum vacuum-booster setup. For those who like to shift their own gears, the new Tacoma still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but improves it with rev-matching for smoother downshifts, anti-stall launch technology, and a clutch start cancel feature that lets you start the pickup in gear on steep terrain.

But in the decades since, the Land Cruiser has evolved into a four-door, four-wheel-drive wagon — ratcheting up the luxury and off-road capability with each new generation. The last version of the legendary Land Cruiser nameplate ended production in 2021. It was a premium machine with many unique mechanical components, and it cost close to $100,000.\n\nThe all-new 2024 Land Cruiser cuts that price by at least a third, making it much more appealing to four-wheel-drive enthusiasts and regular families shopping for a new adventure vehicle. Buyers with a preference for luxury in a similar package can opt for the [Lexus GX 550](/lexus/gx/). It shares much with the new Land Cruiser but offers more power and more towing capability.\n\nThe modern Land Cruiser is smaller than the old model (there's no optional third-row seat), and is built with a personality that’s far less posh. It rides on the same chassis system as the recently redesigned [Toyota Tacoma](/toyota/tacoma/) and [Toyota 4Runner](/toyota/4runner/). As before, it uses a truck-like body-on-frame design with an independent front suspension and coil-sprung solid axle in the rear. The new Land Cruiser is a smooth-riding and well-mannered SUV, whether it’s traveling around town or along a dusty dirt road.\n\nOn the inside, the Land Cruiser is a comfy place to spend time. The cabin of our $76,825 First Edition had padding in all the right places. Unlike many modern SUVs, Toyota did an excellent job of configuring controls. Everything you need to drive the Land Cruiser on- or off-road is located within a few inches of your right fingers.\n\nEvery model of the Land Cruiser has a standard locking rear differential to help maximize traction in the dirt, and some models offer a disconnecting front sway bar to help free up some wheel travel for better traction and more comfort when driving off-road. The Land Cruiser has a much quieter and faster-acting version of Toyota’s Crawl Control system, which delivers a cruise control experience while driving off-road. And when you disconnect that sway bar and shift into low range, this Land Cruiser's off-road capabilities are very impressive and on par or perhaps better than the outgoing model.\n\nToyota ditched the old, thirsty V8 for a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain with slightly less horsepower but even more torque. Toyota says the new Land Cruiser will deliver 23 mpg in combined city and highway driving. That’s almost 10 mpg better than the old model. In our own testing, however, we saw a real-world 17.5 mpg, which isn’t quite as dramatic.\n\nThe Land Cruiser may have a modern powertrain and chassis, but the design harks back to the boxy Land Cruisers of old, drawing particular inspiration from the popular FJ60 wagons. The modern twist should appeal to many loyalists as well as new customers looking for an SUV that exudes off-road authenticity like the [Jeep Wrangler](/jeep/wrangler/), [Land Rover Defender](/land-rover/defender/), and [Ford Bronco](/ford/bronco/) — all of which offer serious trail capability.\n\nThe Land Cruiser, however, is one of the most well-behaved on paved roads, where most of these SUVs will spend their time. Just don’t expect the Land Cruiser to be as well-mannered as the more carlike and less off-road-capable crossover SUVs.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is a promising comeback for the iconic model."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"Toyota’s legendary Land Cruiser returns in a slightly smaller package, with boxy retro styling and a way lower price.

The RX offered a three-row L version for five years, but Lexus dropped the RX-L after 2022, returning to a five-passenger-only RX SUV as it prepared for the TX debut. This was a good move, as the RX-L, built on the standard RX's wheelbase, had only an additional 6 inches of overall length. That meant the third row was not very spacious, and cargo capacity behind the rear seats was cramped. The all-new Lexus TX solves those issues with a longer wheelbase, which results in a spacious cabin, generous cargo capacity with or without rear passengers, and most importantly, a two-passenger third-row seat designed for adults.\n\nDue in dealer showrooms this fall, the TX will challenge other feature-laden three-row SUVs, including the slightly smaller [Acura MDX](/acura/mdx/), [Lincoln Aviator](/lincoln/aviator/), and [Volvo XC90](/volvo/xc90/). The MDX doesn't offer a hybrid version, while the TX comes with three powertrain options: a turbocharged four-cylinder for the TX 350, a hybrid-powered TX 500h, and a TX 550h+ plug-in hybrid with an expected all-electric driving range of 33 miles. The Aviator comes in a standard gasoline-powered turbocharged V6 or plug-in hybrid model, and the XC90 gets a four-cylinder turbo, a supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder, and a plug-in version of the turbo engine covered in a separate [XC90 Recharge](/volvo/xc90-recharge/) review.\n\nAlthough Lexus hasn't released a full list of features and options by trim level, we expect all versions to be well-equipped luxury SUVs.

The first variant, called the E-Ray, will be a performance hybrid model, not a full electric vehicle. Spy photographers caught the undisguised 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray recently as it underwent testing and evaluation. At first, the photos seemed to show a Euro-spec Corvette Z06 convertible, but the lack of black trim elements points to the all-new E-Ray.\n\nSo what can we expect from the E-Ray? It will likely stick with the Chevy Corvette's existing 6.2-liter V8 and add a hybrid motor/generator between the engine and transmission, along with an electric motor or two to drive the front wheels. That means it will be the first production Corvette with all-wheel drive. With the current V8 making 490 horsepower, the E-Ray's combined output with the electric motors likely will surpass 700 hp. That increase in power will be tempered by the battery pack's weight, but we still expect the E-Ray to beat the standard Corvette in a drag race.\n\nThe spy photos do not show a charge port door, which indicates the E-Ray is not a plug-in hybrid. That is a shame, especially since that will limit how long the car can operate in electric-only \"stealth\" mode. Given the Corvette's existing architecture, it's doubtful that engineers can squeeze in a battery with much more than 2 kWh capacity, so the electric enhancements may only add brief moments of extra traction and power for acceleration. With the electric motor(s) powering the front wheels, it's also a safe assumption that there won't be a frunk (front trunk); thankfully the Corvette coupe's rear hatch is surprisingly accommodating.\n\nIn early December, the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray configurator leaked online, and although Chevy took down the web page, savvy viewers captured some quick screenshots. Those images show a monochrome EV-like front styling treatment. The grille surrounds are body-colored instead of the black plastic used on the Z06's air intakes, with wing-like strakes that slice through the grilles. The Corvette E-Ray configurator leak also noted the new electrified Vette will go on sale later this year, but pricing was not displayed. It's a fair bet that it will cost in excess of $100,000, though. If power output exceeds 700 hp and approaches 1,000 hp, we wouldn't be surprised to see prices climb toward $150,000.\n\nWe'll have a more complete picture of what to expect from the 2024 Corvette E-Ray when it officially debuts later this month."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"The upcoming E-Ray is the first electrified Corvette.

There are two cab configurations — double cab and crew cab — both of which offer four doors for easy access.

The perfect size for consumers who need light truck capability, the Maverick was an immediate hit and currently outsells the larger [Ford Ranger](/ford/ranger/) pickup.\n\nPart of the Maverick's appeal is that it doesn't drive like a truck. Built on the same platform as the [Ford Bronco Sport](/ford/bronco-sport/) and [Ford Escape](/ford/escape/), the Maverick is more akin to a crossover SUV that happens to have a truck bed rather than an enclosed cargo area. All Mavericks are four-door crew cabs with seating for five, and they provide plenty of storage locations inside the cabin for added versatility.\n\nThe Maverick is offered with a choice of powertrains: a 250-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or a fuel-efficient 190-horsepower hybrid powertrain, the latter of which is rated at 37 mpg in combined city and highway driving. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available for the non-hybrid variant. Drivers looking to take this small truck on an off-road adventure can choose from two off-road packages, including the Tremor, which was introduced last year.\n\nIt may be a small unibody truck, but the Maverick still has reasonable capability. The bed is only 4.5 feet long, but it offers more than enough room for home improvement or garden supplies. The Maverick's low ride height makes it easy to load the truck bed.\n\nThe Maverick is available with a wide range of accessories that can be powered by outlets in the bed, and there are tie-down cleats to keep loads secure. With either engine option, the compact truck can handle up to 1,500 pounds of cargo in the bed and can tow up to 4,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nAs most pickup trucks have grown in size over the years, the compact Maverick is unusual in the U.S. market.
