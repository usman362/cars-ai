The big difference between the new model and the existing CX-90 is the CX-70 trades a third-row seat for a more efficient cargo area. These vehicles are so similar that it seems odd to market the CX-70 as a vehicle separate from the CX-90.\n\nThe CX-70 is based on the same mechanicals as the CX-90, and the two are twins in every dimension. The CX-70 offers a choice of three powertrains, two with a 3.3-liter turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine (different horsepower levels) with a mild hybrid system for added boost and efficiency. The third is a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model that adds a larger battery pack under the rear seat for the ability to travel about 25 fully electric miles on a charge. You can tell the two models apart at a glance by the wheel arch flares — black on hybrid models and painted body-color on the PHEV. Mazda says the CX-70 weighs within 100 pounds of the CX-90, so ride and handling between the two vehicles is similar.\n\nThe biggest difference between Mazda’s two largest SUVs is that the CX-70 has two rows of seats instead of three. Removing the third row created more room in the cargo hold. In fact, Mazda carved out even more space by expanding the width slightly towards the rear with expanded side panels. There’s a new sub-trunk area for increased storage — away from prying eyes. The CX-70's cabin also has power-folding rear seats.\n\nThe CX-70 competes with a wide variety of two-row SUVs such as the more expensive [BMW X5](/bmw/x5/), [Acura MDX](/acura/mdx/), and [Genesis GV80](/genesis/gv80/) at the upper end where it strikes us as a legitimate bargain. It also plays in the class a notch down in price and prestige with midsize SUVs like the [Hyundai Santa Fe](/hyundai/santa-fe/) and [Jeep Grand Cherokee](/jeep/grand-cherokee/).

The vertical grille, high hood, and slim headlights connected by an LED light bar give the Santa Fe a wide appearance. Bold fender flares contribute to the powerful look, further enhanced by available 21-inch wheels. A large rear tailgate opens considerably wider than the previous generation for easier loading and unloading.\n\nOne of the more noteworthy changes for the 2024 Santa Fe is the return of the third-row seat, now standard in all trim levels. The Santa Fe is still about 7 inches shorter than the three-row Palisade, so they should appeal to different buyers. Most SUVs in this class, such as the [Chevrolet Blazer](/chevrolet/blazer/) and [Honda Passport](/honda/passport/), don't offer a third row.

But in the decades since, the Land Cruiser has evolved into a four-door, four-wheel-drive wagon — ratcheting up the luxury and off-road capability with each new generation. The last version of the legendary Land Cruiser nameplate ended production in 2021. It was a premium machine with many unique mechanical components, and it cost close to $100,000.\n\nThe all-new 2024 Land Cruiser cuts that price by at least a third, making it much more appealing to four-wheel-drive enthusiasts and regular families shopping for a new adventure vehicle. Buyers with a preference for luxury in a similar package can opt for the [Lexus GX 550](/lexus/gx/). It shares much with the new Land Cruiser but offers more power and more towing capability.\n\nThe modern Land Cruiser is smaller than the old model (there's no optional third-row seat), and is built with a personality that’s far less posh. It rides on the same chassis system as the recently redesigned [Toyota Tacoma](/toyota/tacoma/) and [Toyota 4Runner](/toyota/4runner/). As before, it uses a truck-like body-on-frame design with an independent front suspension and coil-sprung solid axle in the rear. The new Land Cruiser is a smooth-riding and well-mannered SUV, whether it’s traveling around town or along a dusty dirt road.\n\nOn the inside, the Land Cruiser is a comfy place to spend time. The cabin of our $76,825 First Edition had padding in all the right places. Unlike many modern SUVs, Toyota did an excellent job of configuring controls. Everything you need to drive the Land Cruiser on- or off-road is located within a few inches of your right fingers.\n\nEvery model of the Land Cruiser has a standard locking rear differential to help maximize traction in the dirt, and some models offer a disconnecting front sway bar to help free up some wheel travel for better traction and more comfort when driving off-road. The Land Cruiser has a much quieter and faster-acting version of Toyota’s Crawl Control system, which delivers a cruise control experience while driving off-road. And when you disconnect that sway bar and shift into low range, this Land Cruiser's off-road capabilities are very impressive and on par or perhaps better than the outgoing model.\n\nToyota ditched the old, thirsty V8 for a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain with slightly less horsepower but even more torque. Toyota says the new Land Cruiser will deliver 23 mpg in combined city and highway driving. That’s almost 10 mpg better than the old model. In our own testing, however, we saw a real-world 17.5 mpg, which isn’t quite as dramatic.\n\nThe Land Cruiser may have a modern powertrain and chassis, but the design harks back to the boxy Land Cruisers of old, drawing particular inspiration from the popular FJ60 wagons. The modern twist should appeal to many loyalists as well as new customers looking for an SUV that exudes off-road authenticity like the [Jeep Wrangler](/jeep/wrangler/), [Land Rover Defender](/land-rover/defender/), and [Ford Bronco](/ford/bronco/) — all of which offer serious trail capability.\n\nThe Land Cruiser, however, is one of the most well-behaved on paved roads, where most of these SUVs will spend their time. Just don’t expect the Land Cruiser to be as well-mannered as the more carlike and less off-road-capable crossover SUVs.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is a promising comeback for the iconic model."},"overview":null,"editorial({\"section\":\"VERDICT\"})":{"__typename":"VehicleEditorial","text":"Toyota’s legendary Land Cruiser returns in a slightly smaller package, with boxy retro styling and a way lower price.

Its rivals, the [Rivian R1S](/rivian/r1s/), [Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV](/mercedes-benz/eqs-suv/), [Tesla Model X](/tesla/model-x/), and the upcoming [VinFast VF9](/vinfast/vf9/), all start well above the EV9’s pricing. The VinFast and Rivian base trims might compete price-wise with the top end of the EV9 lineup, but VinFast first must overcome the wave of poor reviews received by its North American debut model, the [VF8](/vinfast/vf8/) two-row crossover.\n\nFor now, the EV9’s likeliest competitors will be the smaller [Mercedes-Benz EQB](/mercedes-benz/eqb/), the three-row version of the [Tesla Model Y Long Range](/tesla/model-y/), and the upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Toyota bZ5X. The latter two are expected to be priced closer to the EV9.\n\nKia is going heavily into electric vehicles, with a target of 14 battery-electric models by 2030.

Already the largest vehicle in the Mini lineup, the new Countryman added a few more inches between the wheels to give it a larger, more practical cabin and a smoother ride. Mini didn't mess with tradition too much, however, as the suspension uses the same overall setup as previous Minis in order to deliver the precise, responsive handling the brand is known for. The new Countryman also benefits from the addition of standard all-wheel drive for sure-footed traction in a variety of conditions.\n\nThe previous Countryman offered a wide range of trims, but the newest version was introduced with just two: the Cooper S and the high-performance John Cooper Works. The Cooper S is powered by a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four cylinder that produces up to 241 horsepower, a huge jump over the previous Cooper S (189 hp). The John Cooper Works gets a more modest boost, from 301 to 312 horsepower. Both use a seven-speed automatic transmission. Mini claims that the Countryman John Cooper Works is capable of a zero to 60 mph time of just 5.4 seconds, which is quick for any vehicle, but especially a compact SUV.\n\nIn addition to the increased passenger room, the Countryman's cabin features an updated design that incorporates a 9.4-inch round touchscreen display in the center of the dash. Most features of the user interface can be controlled with voice activation, a nice plus given the unusual screen design. A mix of cloth and metallic trim gives the interior a modern feel that's a step above most competitors in the class. Mini also added a driver-assist feature that allows for hands-free driving at speeds under 37 mph.\n\nCompetition in the Countryman's category is fierce. On the low end, the [Honda HR-V](/honda/hr-v/) offers similar levels of driving enjoyment and functionality. On the luxury side, the [BMW X2](/bmw/x2/), [Audi Q3](/audi/q3/), and [Volvo XC40](/volvo/xc40/) provide high-quality cabins and refined performance.

That translates to more interior space for both passengers and cargo, which is great since the previous Acadia was criticized for being too small in both areas.

The nearly 500-horsepower five-passenger EV comes in either a standard SUV body style or a more coupe-like Sportback model. How do you spot an SQ8 e-tron compared to the regular Q8 e-tron? Look for the slightly flared-out bodywork covering distinctive wheels and wider tires. The SQ8 e-tron looks muscular and performance-oriented, and has a number of significant upgrades over the standard model.\n\nMost of that work is in the chassis. Audi has retuned the suspension with thicker sway bars and firmer dampers. They’ve made the steering more responsive, as well. But the biggest change is the addition of a second electric motor on the rear axle. When combined with the single front axle motor, it allows this three-motor Audi to instantly send power and torque to the wheels in need. The SQ8 e-tron also has an additional 94 hp and 228 pound-feet of torque over the standard Q8 e-tron. These upgrades help this large and heavy EV tackle sweeping roads and tight corners with the athleticism of a much smaller vehicle. The brake regen system, which helps charge the battery as you slow down, isn’t as aggressive as in some other EVs. For example there’s no “one-pedal” drive mode in which drag from the regen system lets the driver cruise around town, rarely touching the brake pedal. The driver can amp up the regen temporarily by pulling on one of the steering wheel-mounted paddles.\n\nThe SQ8 e-tron cabin is fitted with beautiful textured carbon accents, rich-looking (and comfortable) quilted Valcona leather sport seats, and a sport steering wheel.\n\nThe SQ8 e-tron has few true rivals. The [Tesla Model X Plaid](/tesla/model-x/), which costs just over $94,000, offers longer range and way more speed but is less comfortable and luxurious.
